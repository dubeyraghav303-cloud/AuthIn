## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a vulnerability, please do NOT open a public issue.

Instead, please report it via:
1.  Our **Security Advisory** form on GitHub (preferred).
2.  Emailing `security@authkit.dev` (placeholder).

We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and provide a timeline for a fix.
